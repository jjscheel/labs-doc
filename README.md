# RISC-V Ecosystem Lab Partners Documentation Project

The documentation in this repo is based on the [riscv-admin/template-docs-rtd](https://github.com/riscv-admin/template-docs-rtd/)
project.  It supports building documents with Sphinx in MD and RST, and then publishing to GitHub pages.

To contribute to this project, join the [RISC-V Ecosystem Lab Partners](https://lists.riscv.org/g/lab-partners)
in the RISC-V Portal.

The projects currently being developed are:

1. Becoming an Ecosystem Lab Partner
2. Hosting CI for a community

The current published pages can be found at [https://riscv-admin.github.io/labs-doc/](https://riscv-admin.github.io/labs-doc/).

The build process remains as Sphinx and template remains Read the Docs.

Type `make html` in the top directory to build the document in `docs/html/`.
